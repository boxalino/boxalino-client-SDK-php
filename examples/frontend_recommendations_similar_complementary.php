/**
* In this example, we make a simple recommendation example to display both similar and complementary recommendations on a product detail page (both should be called in one call like in the example here, to avoid the risk that the same recommendations could appear twice which can happen if you do two separate requests). Therefore, consider keeping your bxClient object global, push both requests first and then get the response for each choice id.
